Karim Benzema volleyed over for Real and substitute Martin Braithwaite went close for Barca moments before Vinicius sparked celebrations at the Bernabeu. Substitute Mariano struck in added time as Real moved a point clear of Barca. Mariano had not played a single minute in La Liga for Zinedine Zidane's side this season until being brought off the bench in injury time to seal a memorable win.",
